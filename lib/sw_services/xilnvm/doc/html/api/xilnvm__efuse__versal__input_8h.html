XNVM_EFUSE_USER_FUSES string should be multiples of 8 bytes always. Which means that if the string is 16 bytes, it will program 2 user eFuses. XNVM_EFUSE_PRGM_USER_FUSE_NUM range is 1 to 63.</p>
<p>Example : When XNVM_EFUSE_WRITE_USER_FUSES is TRUE and XNVM_EFUSE_PRGM_USER_FUSE_NUM is 4 - User eFuse number from where to start write. XNVM_EFUSE_NUM_OF_USER_FUSES is 2 - Number of User eFuses to program XNVM_EFUSE_USER_FUSES "1234578ABCDEF58" - User eFuse data to program UserFuse 4 will be programmed with 0x1234578 and UserFuse 5 will be programmed with 0xABCDEF58.</p>
<p>#define XNVM_EFUSE_READ_USER_FUSE_NUM XNVM_EFUSE_PRGM_USER_FUSE_NUM XNVM_EFUSE_READ_USER_FUSE_NUM - User eFuse number from where to start read. By default it reads from XNVM_EFUSE_PRGM_USER_FUSE_NUM</p>

<p>NOTE: The PPK hash should be the unmodified hash generated by bootgen. Single bit programming is allowed for Revocation Id eFuses (0 through 7), however if the user specifies a value that tries to set a bit that was previously programmed to 1 back to 0, program throws an error. Even if the bits are already programmed user must pass these already programmed bits along with the new bits that need to be programmed.</p>
